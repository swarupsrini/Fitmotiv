## Tech

`Express`, `CockroachDB`, `Swift`, `Google Cloud API`, `Vonage API`, `IBM NLU API`, `Azure Cognitive Speech`

## Motives

In today's world, we see 2 recurring problems: social isolation and physical exercise. With my team, I decided to develop an app that solves both these problems. We hope that Fitmotiv encourages more people to stay connected with their loved ones while maintaining a healthy exercise routine. 

## Development

Developed in a team of 4 with 3 engineers and 1 designer. An Express microservice handles the backend and the collaborative 'video call during workout' functionality. All the APIs are integrated here as well. CockroachDB for data storage, Google Cloud for authentication and ML (in development). IBM API for natural language understanding, and Azure Cognitive Speech for the speech-to-text for the voice commands. The app uses Swift for the front-end to make an iOS app.
